# Shards

â€‹	MongoDB fragments data at a collection level, so a shard is like a piece of our data inside the cluster.

## Structure

- Shard
  - Keeps a subset of the data.
  - Can be implemented as a replica set.
  - Horizontal scalability.
- Config Servers
  - Stores metadata.
  - Clusters configurations.
- Mongos: interface between the application and the shard cluster.

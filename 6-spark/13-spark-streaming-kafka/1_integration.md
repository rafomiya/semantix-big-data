# Spark Streaming & Kafka

​	Spark's streaming can be used with many data ingestion tools. We will see how it can be integrated with Apache Kafka, since it is one of the most used data ingestion tools available today.
​	There are two main ways to integrate Spark and Kafka:

- Spark Streaming (DStream): Spark version >= 0.7.0
- Structured Streaming: Spark version >= 2.0.0 (2.3)

​	So to integrate Spark and Kafka, it is recommended to use at least Spark version 2.3.

# Jupyter Notebook

​	First of all, Jupyter is an open source project for software development. It provides many services of interactive computing in many programming languages. 

​	Jupyter Notebook is a web computational environment, in which we can create interactive codes, divided into cells, and documentation in markdown.

## PySpark

​	On our Spark cluster, we have access to a PySpark notebook.
​	In this environment, we can execute ordinary Python code; bash commands, with a `!` prefix; and Spark commands, using the `spark` session variable.
